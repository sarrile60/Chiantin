# Project Atlas - EU Digital Banking Platform

A production-grade banking platform with double-entry ledger, KYC workflows, and comprehensive admin tools.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Phase 1: Core POC ✅
- ✅ Double-entry ledger engine (append-only, reversals, idempotency) - **30/30 tests passed**
- ✅ JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- ✅ TOTP (MFA) implementation
- ✅ Password hashing (Argon2)
- ✅ S3-compatible storage adapter
- ✅ Idempotency store

### Phase 2: Full Application ✅
#### Backend APIs (FastAPI)
- ✅ Authentication (signup, login, MFA setup/enable)
- ✅ User management
- ✅ KYC workflows (document upload, submit, review)
- ✅ Banking (account creation, IBAN issuance - sandbox)
- ✅ Ledger operations (top-up, withdraw, fees, transfers)
- ✅ Admin tools (user management, KYC review, ledger tools)
- ✅ MongoDB with proper indexes

#### Frontend (React)
- ✅ Customer dashboard (account view, balance display)
- ✅ Admin portal (user management, ledger tools)
- ✅ Clean banking UI following design guidelines
- ✅ Authentication flows
- ✅ Protected routes with role-based access

## 📊 Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **Frontend:** React with React Router
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Auth:** JWT (access) + httpOnly refresh cookies
- **MFA:** TOTP (RFC 6238)
- **Storage:** LocalS3 (S3-compatible adapter)

### Core Ledger Design
```
CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: No "set balance" - all changes via ledger posting engine

ledger_accounts → ledger_transactions → ledger_entries
       ↓                    ↓                  ↓
   account metadata    grouping & status    debit/credit
                       (POSTED, REVERSED)   (append-only)
```

**Invariants Enforced:**
1. Double-entry: Σdebits = Σcredits (per currency, per transaction)
2. Append-only: Entries never updated/deleted after posting
3. Reversals: New mirrored entries (swap direction), link to original
4. Idempotency: Same external_id → same result
5. Balance = Σ(credits) - Σ(debits) for account (derived, never stored)

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ Argon2 password hashing  
✅ JWT with short-lived access tokens (15 min)  
✅ httpOnly secure cookies for refresh tokens  
✅ TOTP MFA (Google Authenticator compatible)  
✅ Rate limiting ready (structure in place)  
✅ Audit logging for admin actions  
✅ RBAC with role-based endpoint protection  
✅ Session tracking (device, IP, user-agent)

## 🏦 Banking Features

### Customer Features
- ✅ Account creation with sandbox IBAN
- ✅ Balance viewing (real-time from ledger)
- ✅ Transaction history
- ✅ KYC submission (document upload ready)
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ MFA enrollment

### Admin Features

  - Withdraw (debit user, credit sandbox)
  - Fee charge (debit user, credit fees account)
  - All operations require reason & support idempotency
- ✅ Transaction monitoring
- ✅ User details with account balances

## 🎨 Design System

Follows comprehensive design guidelines at `/app/design_guidelines.md`:
- **Colors:** Trust palette (blue-green primary, no dark gradients)
- **Typography:** Inter (UI) + Space Grotesk (display) + IBM Plex Mono (data)
- **Theme:** Light mode default with dark mode support
- **Professional banking aesthetic:** Clean, minimal, trustworthy

## 🏆 Achievement Summary
