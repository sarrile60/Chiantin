# ECOMMBX Banking Platform - PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Full-stack banking application with KYC, transfers, admin panel, and notification systems.

## Current Status: STABLE (Ready for Production Deploy)

## What's Been Implemented

### Core Features
- User authentication (signup, login, MFA)
- KYC application submission and admin review
- Banking transfers with admin queue
- Support ticket system
- Tax hold management
- Admin notification badge system (database-backed)
- Admin ledger operations (credit/debit accounts)
- User login activity history
- Client transaction history with professional banking details
- **Admin Create User** - Admins can create users directly with IBAN assignment (NEW)

### Recent Features (March 2026)
1. **Admin Create User Feature** - Complete implementation allowing admins to:
   - Create users with first name, last name, email, phone, password
   - Assign custom IBAN and BIC to the bank account
   - Option to skip KYC (auto-approve) or require user to complete KYC
   - User is immediately ACTIVE with email_verified=true (no verification email sent)
   - Backend: POST /api/v1/admin/users/create
   - Frontend: Create User button + modal on Admin Users page

### Recent Hotfixes (February 2026)
1. **KYC Admin Review Actions** - Fixed API contract mismatch
2. **Client KYC Submission** - Fixed endpoint routing
3. **Tax Hold Restrictions** - Restored frontend/backend enforcement
4. **Admin Panel UI Overflow** - Fixed CSS layout issues
5. **Admin Sidebar Badges** - Verified working, fixed KYC status query
6. **Admin Credit Account Blank Page** - Fixed amount→amount_cents field mismatch
7. **Login Activity Panel Empty** - Fixed to query audit_logs instead of auth_events
8. **Client Transaction Rendering** - Fixed admin credit/debit metadata storage for proper display

## Test Credentials
- **Admin:** admin@ecommbx.io / Admin@123456
- **Client:** ashleyalt005@gmail.com / 123456789

## Third-Party Integrations
- Resend (emails)
- Cloudinary (file storage)

## Deployment Notes
- Production URL: https://ecommbx.group
- Backend port: 8001
- Frontend port: 3000
- User needs to shut down old deployment first, then deploy from current task

## Known Issues
- None currently blocking

## Backlog / Future Tasks
- Mobile KYC ghost text issue (could not reproduce - needs user screenshots)
- Performance optimization for large user lists
- Cloudinary raw file handling: Consider migrating old raw files to include proper Content-Disposition headers

## Latest Changes (March 9, 2026)
### P0 Fix: PDF/Document Download from Support Tickets
- **Problem:** Non-image files (PDFs, docs) downloaded from support tickets were corrupted/saved without file extension
- **Root Cause:** Previous fix added file extensions to Cloudinary raw file public_ids, but this Cloudinary account has strict delivery settings that block raw files with extensions in URL (401 ACL failure). Old files without extensions in URL worked fine.
- **Fix (Backend):** Reverted `cloudinary_storage.py` to always strip extension from public_id for all file types. Cloudinary URL returned from upload is used as-is (without appending extension).
- **Fix (Frontend):** Blob-based download handler in `Support.js` fetches the raw URL, creates a Blob, and triggers download with `att.file_name` (which has the correct extension). This ensures the saved file has the proper extension regardless of what Cloudinary's Content-Disposition says.
- **Files Modified:** `backend/providers/cloudinary_storage.py`, `frontend/src/components/Support.js`
- **Testing:** Verified via testing agent (iteration_158) — all tests passed

## Previous Changes (Feb 25, 2026)
- Fixed client transaction history rendering for admin-created credits/debits
- Root cause: Admin topup/withdraw not passing professional banking fields as metadata
- Now properly displays From/To names, IBANs, BIC, references in transaction detail modals

## Verification Log (Feb 25, 2026)
### Transaction Detail Modal Bug - NOT REPRODUCIBLE
- **Reported Issue:** Transaction detail modal not opening for old transactions on full history page
- **Test Results:** All 47 transactions tested (index 0, 10, 20, 46) - modal opens correctly for all
- **Testing Agent:** iteration_148 - 100% pass rate
- **Manual Verification:** Screenshot confirmed modal opens with transaction details
- **Conclusion:** Bug was either already fixed or was intermittent/browser-specific
