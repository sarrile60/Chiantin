## ROLLBACK / RECOVERY READINESS

### Post-Deploy Monitoring Checklist
Monitor these areas immediately after production redeploy:

1. **Transfers Queue** - Verify all tabs load, especially DELETED tab
2. **Support Tickets** - Confirm thread remains visible after admin replies
3. **Notification Counts** - Verify admin self-notification fix holds
4. **Accounts List** - Check for any "accounts.map" errors (regression indicator)
5. **Audit Logs** - Confirm timestamps display correctly
6. **Error Logs** - Monitor for any 500/502/503 responses

### Rollback Trigger Conditions
Initiate rollback if any of the following occur:
- ❌ accounts.map is not a function error appears
- ❌ Support ticket thread disappears after admin action
- ❌ Transfer restore causes financial re-execution
- ❌ Any 500 errors in admin panel
- ❌ Authentication/RBAC failures

### Rollback Procedure
1. Use Emergent platform "Rollback" feature
2. Select checkpoint before Feb 24, 2026 changes
3. Verify rollback completed successfully
4. Notify stakeholders
