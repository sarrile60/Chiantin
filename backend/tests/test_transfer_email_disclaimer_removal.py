Test suite for Transfer Email Disclaimer Removal

Tests verify that:
1. Transfer confirmation email does NOT contain 'do not reply' / 'contact support@...' footer line
2. Transfer rejection email does NOT contain 'do not reply' / 'contact support@...' footer line
3. Both emails STILL contain security warning
4. Both emails STILL contain Contact Support/View Details button
5. Transfer creation workflow works correctly
6. Transfer rejection workflow works correctly
7. Idempotency still works - rejection email flag set correctly
